/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset is in prototyping mode. It prioritizes developer velocity with flexible data shapes.
 * Read permissions for menu items are public. All write operations must be explicitly secured and
 * other data such as order information requires authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /menuItems/{menuItemId}: Publicly readable collection of menu items.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Collection of customer orders, requiring authentication.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Menu Items: The `menuItems` collection is readable by anyone to quickly onboard the application.
 * - Authentication Required for Orders: Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete orders.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is disallowed.
