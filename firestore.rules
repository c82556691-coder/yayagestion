/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset is in "Prototyping Mode," focusing on strong authentication and authorization while relaxing data validation to enable rapid iteration.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *  - Authenticated Access: Any authenticated user (including anonymous) can read and write to the necessary collections for the app to function. This is suitable for prototyping.
 *  - Future Proofing: While open now, the rules are structured to easily add ownership and role-based checks in the future.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *  - /menuItems/{menuItemId}: Contains menu item data.
 *  - /orders/{orderId}: Contains order information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - `menuItems` and `orders` are fully accessible by any authenticated user. This is required for all app views to function in this prototype.
